ChatBot Navigator Demonstrator (AWS LEX)
-------------
This is a basic implementation of Amazon Lex Chat bot to demonstrate features the chat bot can 
do. The Bot has implemented basic support for interaction with user interested in:

 - getting permissions to use WiFi network granted
 - booking taxi (e.g. from office) 
 - search of contact information (location of employee)
 
This repository contains full ChatBot setup (easily importable) in a form of JSON file as well as 
basic "Lambda" function (Python) to validate and handle responses from users.

The "ChatBot" is supposed to be an integral part of on-site navigation framework. 

**WARNING** : This is just a "demonstrator", the code is yet to be finalised!!!
